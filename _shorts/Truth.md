Truth is always amazing. Truth is always That which arrests your
attention. And focuses it on the fullness of meaning. Don't worry when
you're awake. Just because truth, just because love, just because
harmony and peace are as normal as apple pie. Doesn't mean that they
Ever lose Their awesomeness.
