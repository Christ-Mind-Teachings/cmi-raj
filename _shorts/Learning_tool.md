If you are looking at God and saying that isn't God. Then that what you
were looking at and and denying the truth of. Becomes the point where
clarification needs to occur. Therefore, that which you are calling not
God becomes a learning tool. And once the learning has occurred and it
is recognized for what it is, it ceases to be a learning tool. But it
doesn't disappear. The fact is you won't lose anything. You will have it
more completely. And it's because you did not create yourself that you
do not have the capacity to uncreate yourself. And it is because you did
not create yourself that you do not have the capacity. To successfully
think that you have created yourself and can creatively modify that
creation indefinitely. You can sidetrack yourself as in a daydream in a
school classroom, but you can't make the classroom go away and you can't
make the education that is occurring there stop. But you can miss the
learning for a while. Until You realize that it's all about an
experience. And you're willing to abandon making a great deal out of
your process. You won't yield into the experience. You won't engage in
the experience, and therefore you, you will not take the first essential
step. Which constitutes the return of your sanity.
