It is not an involuntary act to turn toward the altar. What happens as a
result of genuinely turning to the altar ends up being involuntary. But
you The Christ that you are. As ignorant of your Christhood as you might
be. Has to arrive at a point. Of deciding for turning toward the altar.
Of deciding for finding the better way to be with your brother or your
sister or your mate. On your own for your reasons, you will have to
arrive at a point where you are miserable enough to say there must be a
better way and turn your very own attention by virtue of your very own
decision to the altar. The reason for turning to the altar is to find
out what your function is and to experience it so that you might turn to
your brother and extend it.
