## {{page.title}}

God is specifically identified. You are both universal and specific.
From the infinite aspect, all of you. are for lack of better descriptive
words. Occupying the same space. And this is one of the reasons that
being awake is such an intimate experience. Language doesn't allow me to
express it. Better than that. But you, you are all one and yet you are
all distinctly individualized expressions of God. And so your connection
with everyone else is infinitely total, always. And yet You're you. And
the experience of being universal and specific is not confusing in any
way.
