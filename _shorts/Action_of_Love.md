Assume that you don't know, you're going to have to even acknowledge
that you don't know, and you're going to have to be willing to allow for
the fact that you personally don't need to know. So that you might
abandon all attempts to know on your own and take the time to become
still within yourself and ask, what do I need to say, what is the
appropriate response? What would you say, Father? Or ask the Holy Spirit
or ask your guide or ask me and then because you don't know what the
appropriate response should be you share the response you get. And what
you get in one circumstance might be sit down, close your mouth, and be
still for a moment. Which might not sound gentle or loving or pacifying
but for that individual, it will be perfect because that individual is
feeling very scattered, very disconnected, very unstable, and needs
direction at that very moment, clear, simple, direction to follow so that
that individual can become disentangled from all of the confusion.

Somebody else might look at that and say, oh, you're being very
controlling, how can that be healing? You see, when the fact is that
it's not control at all, it's the presentation of that which meets
the need for someone who at the moment doesn't have the inner strength
and discipline to provide those simple directions for themselves. So
sometimes what you end up saying won't sound sweet.

And other times where the circumstances might seem to be quite the same
and you are dealing with an unruly individual, what you might find
yourself saying is, I love you and walking up and giving a hug, even
though the individual has been displaying aggressive physical
characteristics. And that will be what helps that one to soften, settle
down, become quiet and accomplish or end up doing what the words sit
down, shut up.

You see, and this takes trust. But if you don't dare to
inquire if you don't dare to turn to the altar and make your connection
there then firmness or softness expressed is just a manipulation
arising out of ignorance and one's best assumption of what will work.
And without the unction of love, there will be no transformation. You
will not be a real agent for change.
