The what I have referred to as the human condition, which is uh best
described as A partial experience of reality. is experienced because One
has claimed the capacity. To perceive things independent of The way God
has created them. And so Each one has created a sense of isolation from
the whole. And The most effective means of gaining access to the whole
again is to break the isolation. And the only way to effectively break
the isolation is to reach out for and connect with one who is awake. The
moment each one broke away, so to speak, and claimed a right to
independence, the very fact that they couldn't possibly succeed in
breaking away. Established a means of undoing the act of independence.
And that means of undoing the act of independence was A guide, one who
was assigned to you. To be there when you finally decided to reach out.
