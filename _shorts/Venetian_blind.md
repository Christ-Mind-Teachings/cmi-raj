## {{page.title}}

I've used the illustration of the Venetian blinds in a, in a window
where there's no glass and there is a breeze. If the slats are open.
Which is the equivalent of being undefended. The breeze can blow through
and only cause a gentle movement of the blinds. But if the slats are
closed, which would be the equivalent of defendedness, then the breeze
moving through the window will jangle the Venetian blind wildly.
Whatever it is that you would determine to be a distraction. You must
learn to be Less defended against. So that those distractions become
part of what you're willing to embrace. From the simplicity within you.
You see what I'm saying? The call is not to be so sensitive that you can
only be present with a tiny, tiny part of the kingdom of heaven that
seems to be unlike the kingdom of heaven. You need to learn not to be so
sensitive. To the dynamics of life. That the dynamics of life become to
you a distraction from Being with them. From the simplicity of you. As
well as The specific place you are wanting to give your attention to
from the simplicity of you, you see my point. The call is for including
the things that You would determined to be distractions from the
simplicity of your being.
