Someone has asked me to comment on. Quote, the larger temporal sequence,
unquote. You know what that simply means that, that the miracle occurs
within your present frame of reference. In other words, love meets the
human need. It makes you right where you are, while you still believe
you're not awake while you still believe you are a body. It meets you
Right where you are. Without frightening you to death by your having an
experience of such radical transformation that it would be nonsensical
to you. And so, You seem to have experiences of collapsed time within a
still ongoing experience of time. But as I said, that in itself begins
to weaken your faith in time, your commitment to it, and your bondage to
it. And In that weakening of the apparent validity of time, you will
arrive at a point where time will cease and everything will still make
sense to you. So it does it within the larger temporal sequence because
that's the only way your return to sanity can happen. Without increasing
your insanity because great fear has been brought into play. And so it
is a kindness, OK.
