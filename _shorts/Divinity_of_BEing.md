Life itself is divine. And the divinity of it. is what constantly
insinuates itself into your conscious awareness. And causes all of your
attempts to be competent to fail. And ultimately bring great
discouragement to you. It is the divinity of being that brings
discouragement to the false sense of self that's trying to proclaim its
competence. So What drives you to the bottom of the barrel is reality,
exerting itself, you might say, being what's real. It is. Your divinity
Disallowing. You to be comfortably insane. So no matter how you arrive
at The jewel That was hidden in the darkness. No matter how you arrive
at it. Whether it seems to be circumstances or a spiritual desire to
wake up. It's still the divinity of being. Which brings you to that
point.
