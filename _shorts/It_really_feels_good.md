I know I'm beginning to sound repetitious, but For lack of better words,
the energy of our communion together. is I'm going to put it this way,
less and less dense. And therefore more and more enjoyable. And although
it is impossible for me to feel bad, I can only convey to you what I
need to convey to you by saying it really feels good to be with you in
this way. And It has been a most pleasant experience. And I want to say
thank you.
