There were a few gifts I made. One of the gifts was that I showed you.
that death is not a power or a presence. That it does not govern. You,
it does not govern life. It does not override life. You could say
physical evidence was provided. That no act No hateful act. No illness,
no disease, no accident. can interrupt. Your existence. By demonstrating
that fact about me, I demonstrated that fact about you. and gave you
Absolutely clear, palpable, practical evidence of it. So that it wasn't
just a nice thought. A nice idea. And what did I also demonstrate? that
your eternality is always Identified With visibility and tangibility or
what you would call form. Creation is always identified and
identifiable. And there will always be that which is the visibility and
tangibility of you. I also demonstrated. Another part of the gift I
gave. The fact That there's nothing your brother can do to you. That can
affect Your uninterruptible existence. And so you don't need to be
afraid of your brother. Whether he's brandishing a spear. Or a gun Or
any other weapon that can seem to take your life. That doesn't mean That
it will be easy But it means it's worth the effort. Because the outcome
is sure. If you're willing to take The radical champs.
