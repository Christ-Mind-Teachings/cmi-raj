The body does not exist except as a learning device for the mind. I
brought out that the body is like the effulgence or glow around the
altar. And when one turns one's back on the altar and one does not see
That the glow is from the altar. And one denies its divinity. That very
thing becomes a learning device. Whatever of the infinite presence of
God you are denying becomes a learning device because it becomes the
specific opportunity to remember God. And once you have remembered God
and seen it for what it truly is, it ceases to be a learning device
because you aren't suffering from ignorance needing to be corrected.
