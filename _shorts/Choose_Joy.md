## {{page.title}}

I want to point out to all of you that when there seems to be threat.
You gather your structures tightly about you and you try to be very much
in control and not allow change. You try to become rigid and therefore
strong. And yet You need to be Supple So that you may flow with the
movement of life. You must do exactly the opposite thing. Instead of
become defensive. Armored Stiff Defended And unpenetrable. Unreachable.
It does feel good When you don't realize That the nice neat little
orderly package of your life. Really isn't very alive. You see, Water
flows downhill effortlessly. Where there are openings, it flows in.
Where the door is open, fulfillment comes. Just because that's the way
it works. I'm encouraging you to keep your attention on. The constant
movement of fulfillment that you are becoming supple enough to flow
with. And let there be an ongoing sense of wonder, wonderment, openness
too. The unexpected manifestations of fulfillment. Choose for your joy.
Its presence is a fact. But your experience of it is a choice. As things
move into flux, as I said, the tendency is to Become serious. That's
another way of becoming strong. Heaven help you should you get caught up
in a wave of joy that would sweep you off your feet and into God knows
what.
