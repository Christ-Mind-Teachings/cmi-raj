You are all teaching. In indirect ways. And even with the highest
motives. The infrastructure that is firmly established. Says You get
this for that. Tit for tat. It's a barter. It's a bargain. It's not a
gift. Love It is a gift. And as you turn toward the altar. And as you
open yourself up for learning, What's the fundamental lesson going to
be? Love It's going to be How to learn to embody love. And that is
indeed going to require you to be. From a new foundation. From your
connection with your source. So that you are reflecting and glorifying
God, embodying God, embodying truth, embodying love. Quote in the world,
unquote, meaning right where everyone else is still stuck in the rut.
Right where everyone else. Has a devotion to the very thing. That they
need to abandon. to let go of and explore. The possibility of living
without exercising authority. But rather yielding to God. And his
authorship. Of everything that identifies your fulfillment.
