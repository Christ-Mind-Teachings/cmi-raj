If you read it one way, recognize your errors, it could sound like it's
a call for an ongoing internal witch hunt to uncover every single error
that might be lurking there. But you could say recognize your error and
choose to abandon it if you mean your choice to think alone. Recognize
the error of choosing to think independently of the father and choose to
abandon it by following my guidance by yielding to something outside
yourself. And thus break the isolation. You see, then it doesn't become
a matter of yielding to my authority. It amounts to abandoning. The very
thing that is keeping you from experiencing fulfillment. And it's not
all the different things you are thinking incorrectly. It is the very
fact that you are choosing to think at all. Do you see?
