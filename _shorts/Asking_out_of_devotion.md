## {{page.title}}

When you desire of God to know the truth about a brother or about a
situation. And your reason for asking is because you have made that one
an object of your affection and you care and you are expressing a
devotion. And you want to be a mentor in this situation. You will find
yourself because of your quietly expressed desire. Your gently expressed
desire. You will find yourself in filled with A new perspective, a
sudden shift of perception. That will reveal your brother or sister to
you in a new light, as I've said before. His or her divinity will be
obvious to you, along with the realization of yours as well. There will
be an intimacy whether you've expressed the miracle, the sudden shift of
perception or not. And the potential is there for your brother or sister
to experience instantaneous and sudden transformation as well. In a
moment in the twinkling of an eye. And the situation will be harmonized,
resolved instantly, which otherwise might have taken days or weeks or
months of therapy. Or of reasoning one's way through the maze, you see.
There are no private thoughts. There are not only are no private
thoughts, there are no private experiences. There is no private love.
