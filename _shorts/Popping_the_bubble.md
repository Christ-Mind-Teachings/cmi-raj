If a mind perceives without love. It perceives A soap bubble It
perceives A boundary It perceives only limits. And is unaware of the
spirit within. I have said before that the ego is like the sphere. Of a
soap bubble fragile, thin, insubstantial. But very visible, very
definite. Your present sense of yourself. Is the space inside the
bubble. And you and your totality are the space inside the bubble and
All of the space outside the bubble. But if a mind perceives without
love, it perceives an empty shell. It doesn't perceive that it's a full
shell because it's preoccupied with the finiteness of the boundary and
Either protecting itself against it or enlarging the boundary. And
again, if the bubble represents the ego. The bubble itself is a defense
mechanism. It is the only element in existence. That implies or suggests
The need for defense, the existence of defense, when the bubble pops.
There is nowhere to be found. Anything which gives meaning to the word
defense. The bubble isn't even really there.
