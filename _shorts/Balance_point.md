## {{page.title}}

It is no more predictable than a wave that a surfer is riding. You just
give your attention to being on the balance point of the wave. You be
present every moment. And you don't wonder where you're going, how long
it's going to take, whether you're moving fast enough, whether you're
moving too slow, and so on. The balance point is the key. That's where
your attention needs to be.
