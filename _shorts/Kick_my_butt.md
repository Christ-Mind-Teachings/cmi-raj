Oh, Daddy, won't you please make me do it? Won't you, won't you kick my
butt and bring me into line? No. No. Each of you has to choose for your
sanity, yourself. Your insanity Hasn't altered The truth about you in
any way. But you've chosen To be willful And you have to abandon the
willfulness yourself. It's simple. Unfortunately, it means you can't be
enticed back. You can't be coerced. You can be invited But manipulation.
No one of us who is awake will waste our time attempting to manipulate
your mind.
