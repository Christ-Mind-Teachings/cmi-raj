I love you. Talk to me this week. Talk to me tonight. Don't call Paul on
the phone to talk to me. Sit down and shut up. And say Raj, And wait for
me to respond. Feel for my response. And keep persisting Because It's
inevitable. That we will connect It's unavoidable. Because I love you.
Because I am love. And because my only function is To extend it, to
embrace you in it. And to illuminate the experience of it. In you So
that it's not just a nice thought. And if I love you this way, God loves
you this way. Because I am. Expressing the father. I am love And I'm not
outside my father's house. And the love with which I love you is the
love the Father is. Embracing you with and embodying as you. And I am
conveying to you that fact. So that you might dare to abandon your
Commitment to fear and self defense. That keeps you locked in the dream.
