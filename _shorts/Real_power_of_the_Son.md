There it is, bold as life. Except ye become as little children, means
that unless you fully recognize fully. Fully without reserve fully
recognize your complete dependence on God. Uh, you will not get there.
Because Once you realize your complete dependence on God and joining
occurs fully, you will still be completely dependent on God because you
were never created as an independent anything. That's how absolute this
is. Now Except ye become as little children means that unless you fully
recognize your complete dependence on God, you cannot know the real
power of the Son in His true relationship with the Father. That's as far
as one can go in encouraging you. Because Your ego says that to be
completely dependent. Means to have no power. But this is telling you
that when you do acknowledge your complete dependence, your total
personal incompetence. You will know. The real power. Of the son in his
true relationship with the Father. It is not going to be a loss of any
kind.
