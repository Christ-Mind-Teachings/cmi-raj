If you dare for a moment. To think that I exist. That I really exist and
that I'm available to you. And then you acknowledge or are willing to
believe that I've been exactly where you are. And know exactly how
you're feeling. And that I'm no longer in that place. Then you have A
justification for saying Well, if he did it, I can do it. Not only that,
he did it and he says, That it's now his function. To stand with me as I
do that and help me.
