I'm going to make a fine distinction here. Belief produces the
acceptance of existence. Knowing Produces the acceptance of being. I am
indicating thereby that the word existence refers to what you are
experiencing in a separated state. The word existence has an opposite,
nonexistence. The word being does not have an opposite.

Now, as you invite clarity, as you invite clarification, as you are
willing to say, not my will but thine be done and then listen for it and
then be congruent with it, your beliefs improve and you experience the
results of your improved belief.

But the goal is to completely abandon belief in favor of the direct
experience of knowing that is present as your conscious experience of
being when you are not thinking. And so the void that one arrives in as
a result of abandoning thinking, is pregnant with reality, is pregnant
with infinity, is pregnant with eternity, is pregnant with the conscious
experience of everything from God's point of view. And that is the
conscious experience of *It is the Father's good pleasure to give you
the kingdom*.
