## {{page.title}}

Truth cannot deal with errors that you want. God cannot force you. To
see the truth when you want to see something else. God is not unaware.
That you are distressed. But he also knows. That your distress It is
unreal And that your being is not threatened in any way by your
Thrilling And frightening imaginations. And like a father of a human
child, God loves you. With a nurturing love that is sufficient. To
Convey to you The true state of peace that is yours. But if like a
child, you are so fascinated by the excitement of the terror. That
you're unwilling to let go of it. No matter how much Comforting is
provided. It won't be felt. Until you like the child. Withdraw your
investment of energy in your reaction. And your preoccupation with your
imagination.
