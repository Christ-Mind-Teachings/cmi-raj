You are always all the presence of love. Sometimes you wonder. How can
he listen to all of us wailing? Well, I hear it. But what I experience
is the love that you are and the love that you are perfectly being at
every moment. You could say Is the ongoing reassurance that you are
providing me with that says What you're believing Isn't harming you at
all. You haven't been able to make your imaginations real. And so I
know. Because of the impeccable love that each of you cannot stop being.
And that is loving me. That you are assured. Of Abandoning The wish, the
wish you have to be personal private creators. That ultimately are
causing your whaling. So I just want you to know. How complete and how
ultimate you are at this moment. And that's why awakening is literally a
journey without distance.
