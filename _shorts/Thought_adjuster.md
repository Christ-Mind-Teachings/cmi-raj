The altar is The living active presence of God being all there is of
you, and God is not a thought adjuster. If there is any thought
adjuster, it's the Holy Spirit. Your guide and the Holy Spirit have the
same function, and everyone who is awake, who works with you, has that
function. To help you. Give permission. To have a new idea that is a
closer approximation of the truth. A thought adjuster cannot actually
make an adjustment like a chiropractor. A thought adjuster or the Holy
Spirit. Can make It inviting to you. Can make it desirable to you. To
make a shift to allow a shift. But to abandon a bad definition. Or to
abandon your commitment to a definition that Doesn't Embody truth. But
that's all the thought adjuster can do. It's like grease the way. So
that you might even slip. OK.
