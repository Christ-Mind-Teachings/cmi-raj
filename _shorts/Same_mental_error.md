## {{page.title}}

It isn't the world, it's the mind and the mind is the same. The ego
frame of reference is the same today as it was yesterday as it was 2000
years ago, and the way out of the ego frame of reference will always be
the same. Today The ego has high tech means of screwing you out of your
birthright. That it didn't have 2000 years ago. But It's still the same
mental error. It's still the same. Mental aberration. The dynamic of
scamming is identical today to what it was 100 years ago or 2000 years
ago. You see, the one thing that can't change. Is mined with a capital
M. And therefore, in the human condition, the one thing that can't
change is mind with a small m. And awakening is the undoing. Of the mind
with a small m. The ego. You, you get the picture.
