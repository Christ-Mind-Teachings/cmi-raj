You've got to engage the yes. Which means Sharing Giving voice to The
truth Protecting the truth, not attacking their ignorance. Protecting
the truth by giving it voice. And Here is one of the characteristics,
the key characteristic of the Christ. It shares the truth. With love It
shares the truth with respect. That the person doesn't even feel he or
she deserves. And it does this persistently. Like a drop of water
wearing away at a stone. The Christ has the willingness. To express the
truth lovingly and in the ways that are most likely to be able to be
recognized by the one you're speaking to. As many times as it needs to
be said in order for the truth of it to be recognized without it being
forced upon. The one you're sharing it with. There's no way to get that
over with quickly. And you know what, ultimately you're not doing that.
Just until everyone wakes up. You're doing it forever because that
really is at the bottom line, your nature, your character, your
function, your purpose. That's you glorifying God.
