## {{page.title}}

If you are undefended, even momentarily. Without any choice on your part
to turn toward the altar. You turn toward the altar. And you are In A
mode of receptivity. You are available Even though you're not thinking
of it consciously. What we're talking about has nothing to do with
thinking at all. It doesn't have anything to do about thinking about
dignity. It isn't about thinking about charity, but the extension of the
gift. That you are infilled with because you were undefended. Is
charity. And it is given to one that the ego would say is unworthy of
the gift. Or one that the intellect would say is a gift beyond that
one's capacity to receive, but it's, it's all charity. And it's not
about thinking about charity at all.
