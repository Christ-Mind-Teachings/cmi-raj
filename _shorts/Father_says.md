The concept of yourself. The definition of yourself that says you are a
creator on your own. is false. And you say, whoa, you're going to take
away my identity. You're going to take away My authority Why are you
against me? Why do you want to undermine? My respectability, my dignity.
My very being And the father says, because that isn't your being. I am
your being. You and I are one. And in that oneness you are infinite. And
in that oneness your unending love. And in that oneness, the glory of
all that exists dawns upon you as the glory of the infinitude of your
being. Inseparable from me. And I cannot Agree with you. When you say
that this The authority that you think you have is real. And I cannot
agree with you when you say that if I take that away from you, you will
be less than whole. Because when you let go of it, you will be whole
beyond conception. You will be and experience wholeness beyond your most
ingenious imaginative definition.
