You see When you look on The results of your thoughts. that were good.
And you see that they are good. You see that they are truly good. You
see that they are eternally good. You're placing a benediction on them.
Just as the father did. And God saw everything that he had made, and
behold, it was very good. That's a benediction. That's love. That's an
acknowledgement of truth. So do you see that? The making of the
distinction between what's of value and what isn't. Constitutes a choice
that you make. Where what is valueless is obviously valueless. And you
let go of your valuing of it. And it's gone. And what is of value. You
recognize as good. As of the nature of God. And of the nature of the
real you. And so making the distinction allows you to clearly Glorify
God. It's a holier thing. Then making distinctions between right and
wrong and self-righteously declaring it. It's a holy thing. To make the
distinction. So that what is not of value no longer receives your
attention because clearly it is meaningless to you.
