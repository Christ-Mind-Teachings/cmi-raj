Divine love always appears to you in the language of your present
awareness. It does not require you to stand taller than you feel capable
of. The Holy Spirit Your divinity held in trust while you dally with the
ego has the means of disclosing to you. That which will reduce fear and
promote healing even if it's not the ultimate truth. This is also very
important for you to understand. There are times that I have been
accused of uh not being consistent. From a conversation with one person
at one time and a conversation with someone else at another time
apparently talking about the same subject. But the fact is that the
truth was presented to each of them in language that allowed for the
greatest inner movement to occur. Because it didn't raise their level of
fear. But reduced it.
