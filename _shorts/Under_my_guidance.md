Oh no. There it is again. Bring your thoughts. Under my guidance. It's
getting monotonous, isn't it? But what is getting monotonous is pure
simplicity. It's reminding you that the answer isn't complicated. And
when, when you reach for my guidance, you are in effect turning back to
the altar. You are choosing not to be independent. You're choosing to
join. Joining occurs as a result of your connection with the altar in
the middle of you.
