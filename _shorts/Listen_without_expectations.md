## {{page.title}}

You need to dare to listen without expectations of any kind. As to what
you're going to hear, how it's going to be expressed, what it's going to
sound like. And I promise you one thing, what you hear will always be
perfect for you. Look at this with delight, like being an explorer.
Listen, with full open consciousness. Placing no limits whatsoever on
what you're going to hear. Be full open in your listening.
