If you're not seeing The kingdom of heaven because you're sitting in the
middle of it with your eyes all squinched up. It obviously isn't going
to take much to wake up in the sense that opening your eyes up is not a
laborious act. So the act of opening up your eyes will not seem
miraculous even though it will transform your entire experience of
being. Period. You might say it will change you forever, but the
magnitude of the act of opening up your eyes is inconsequential.
