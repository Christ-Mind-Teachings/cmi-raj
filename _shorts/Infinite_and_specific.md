It's all the kingdom of heaven. Whether you're not seeing it truly and I
am seeing it truly, it still is the only thing it is, which is reality,
the kingdom of heaven. I can see everything you see. Accept your
misperceptions. I can't see it the way you're seeing it. I can hear your
descriptions of it the way you're seeing it. But I can't see it the way
you're seeing it. The only difference between us at this very moment is
that you're not seeing all of what you're seeing in its true aspect. And
I am. And so I'm right here with you. And I'm also everywhere
omnipresently with you because the fact is that you are omnipresent as
well. You are infinite and specific simultaneously. So there will always
be the specific identification of your presence. But you're not confined
to it. The problem is you are limiting your vision. Of infinity and
eternity by choosing to view it. From entirely within the specific
identification of you. Instead of the infinite conscious awareness of
you that fills all space.
