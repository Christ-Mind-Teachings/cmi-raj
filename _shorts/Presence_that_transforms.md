## {{page.title}}

Healing as release from fear. And release from fear occurs. As you turn
away from that which is fearsome. And engages your ego responses. And
turning toward the altar. So that you might reconnect with The father's
love that's at the center of the altar. Being all there is of you. And
by turning toward it, you provide yourself with the opportunity of
remembering yourself. And in remembering yourself and embracing it. You
become the presence that transforms. And you come back into your right
mind. Maybe only little by little. But the only reason it's little by
little is because more will scare you shitless. I love you all.
