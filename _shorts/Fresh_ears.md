No. The message is that there's somewhere other to be. Then inside the
prison, you see. But if you think that what's going to come is going to
be like what already came. And that it's just going to be a new message
for you to write on the wall. There will be no release. No liberation,
you see. So you've got to listen. with totally fresh ears. Because the
answers will come in totally fresh language. With meanings that haven't
dawned on you yet.
