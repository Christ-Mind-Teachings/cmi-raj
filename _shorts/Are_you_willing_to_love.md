Love is the willingness to recognize that which is real in each and
everything. That which is divinely real. Are you willing to see that
which is real? In everyone you know. It requires a willingness to love.
Are you really willing? To love Everyone you know. When you're blocking
your capacity to embrace with love. You are causing a hurt in yourself,
all by yourself, and you need to be free of that. Right where every
single individual is. is a divine one so beautiful. And so perfect. And
so much the embodiment of love. that you deserve to be experiencing it.
Even if that one doesn't know it about himself or herself yet. If you're
going to be the salvation of the world, you've got to be willing to
anchor God in the world. By choosing to get past your unwillingness. To
see the truth there.
