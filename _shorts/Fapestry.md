There's an absolute divine order. To being. To life And I've used the
illustration of a tapestry before. Where there is a thread that runs
continuously. From the beginning to the end of the carpet. But it only
surfaces where it becomes part of the exquisiteness of the design that
the carpet is there to embody and express. And In the process of
awakening. You come to a point of being willing to appreciate which
thread is up while it's up. And Not fussing about the other color that
isn't showing up. And being in utter harmony with the design of God.
You've got to be willing to allow for a larger picture. In your current
mutually agreed upon definitions. Allow you to see And then you will
have joy. Be in that moment with what you are doing. With the desire To
see God in it. And to feel the movement of God in it. So that you might
be flowing perfectly with it. And when it's time to be through, you will
find yourself moved out. Into the next Movement of fulfillment.
