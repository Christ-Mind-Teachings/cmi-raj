Your kingdom is the kingdom that it's the Father's good pleasure to give
you and always has been giving you. Your kingdom is the one that is your
inheritance. As long as you see yourself as separate from God, His
kingdom will seem to be something you stand in receipt of, but when you
join with the Father. The kingdom I experienced as your being. And it
waits for you. Because it is you. It waits for you to re embrace it. It
waits for you to re-embrace yourself. And you re-embrace yourself by
embracing the Father as the Father that makes you the Son, or you the
offspring. And the moment you reestablish the fatherhood of God by
claiming The daughter ship or the sonship. Of God Then the father and
the son become one. Once again, As your conscious experience. And that's
what this is all about.
