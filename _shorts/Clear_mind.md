You will find that as you yield more consistently, Into divine guidance.
As you lean into the Father more and more. As you yield into his
perspective more and more. There will come a point like the 100th monkey
principle where Enough of your mind is clear. That the rest of the
illusions. Will, will suddenly vanish. In the meantime, be aware that
there will appear to be that dichotomy. Don't fuss about it. Don't let
the ego tell you that it's proof. That what you're believing isn't true.
Or that you will never be able to relinquish at all. And you persist And
you persist right in the face of whatever the ego throws at you. By
choosing to give preference. To the eye that is looking toward the
altar. And persisting in that. And persisting in it. You begin to
establish a habit. And there is. Blessing after blessing that comes as a
result. That inspires you and encourages you to persist. With even more
willingness, let's say with less resistance. Until finally you will find
yourself catapulted. The rest of the way. Persistence Requires decision.
It requires determination. And the ego will tell you it's too much work.
