## {{page.title}}

It is a call It is a global call. It is a global roll call, if you will.
Inviting people. Inviting everyone. To discover The part they can play.
By being involved together In standing with what is of value. And
standing Against What is not of value. Not against With force But
against In the awareness That what is valueless is meaningless. There is
a global call. For unity of intent. To demand The expression of
intelligence. And love And respect for every single individuality. And
nothing less. Even though this will seem to infringe on free will. Which
Too many are intent upon valuing. To the point where no distinction is
being made. Between the allowability of free will that harms. And free
will that heals. It is time for mankind. To discover Its global
capacity. To speak on behalf of global humaneness. It is time for
mankind to globally Discover its integrity. And that it has a capacity
to exert its integrity. On behalf. Of the integrity of every man, woman,
and child on the globe. And thereby experience a unity that transcends
national. Ego interests.
