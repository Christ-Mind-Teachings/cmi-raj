The key thing to be aware of is That to whatever degree you become less
defended against experiencing reality. And to whatever degree, reality
is clearer to you. Everyone is blessed. In other words, your awakening
is never a private affair. And therefore Every little bit of increasing
clarity you experience. is shared. But the point is, it's shared
automatically, not shared because that's your intent. It is not a shared
experience because that's what you want for everyone. It's just the way
it works. When you withdraw. Some of your commitment to the mutual
agreement to see things as they are not. That mutual agreement lessens
and those still involved in the mutual agreement. Cannot Willfully Keep
the light turned down. This is good news. It's good news to just be
aware of.
