## {{page.title}}

The love with which you are all loving each other. Is the energy of
spirit. And it is light. And you stand in such illumination. I am
telling you this. So that when you are in your darkest moment, you might
not take that darkest moment so seriously. And in not taking it quite so
seriously. Cause yourself to be vulnerable to To the experience of love.
Of the love with which all of you are blessing each other. And the love
that I am extending to you. And you need to have a glimpse of just how
fragile the dream is, just how fragile the suffering is. And how easily
It can crack apart. And disappear
