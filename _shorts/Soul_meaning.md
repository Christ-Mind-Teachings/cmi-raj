## {{page.title}}

Soul is your capacity to sense slash feel. The utterly divine meaning of
everything. In other words, Soul is the conscious experience of the
meaning of God in each and everything. And I have mentioned before that
If bodies were to pass through each other because they are not dense
truly as you are experiencing them at the moment. The experience. The
sole experience. can only be described as Being The height of A sexual
experience. Magnified infinitely. Because There's no reservation.
There's no reluctance to feel fully the divine meaning. Of whatever it
is that one passed through. And it is a different aspect of experience
than the undefended connection that all of the brotherhood has with each
other constantly.
