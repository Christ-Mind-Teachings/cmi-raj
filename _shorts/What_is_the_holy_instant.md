What's the holy instant? The holy instant is the act. The place in which
you yield and say yes to God. And the yes means you're turning your
attention to God. Listening so that you might be the place where the
will of God and the perspective of God fills you up and passes through
you. As a blessing to your brothers, sisters, world. And on and on and
on. If you want the holy instant to happen, then you've got to shift
from getting to giving. You've got to shift to being willing to be a
mentor.
