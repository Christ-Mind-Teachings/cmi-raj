## {{page.title}}

You're a thought of God. And how beautiful indeed are the thoughts of
God. who live in his light. Rather than in the darkness of your own
imagined private authority and ability to succeed at overcoming the
duality and the conflict that you've created by turning your back on the
altar without having to turn your face toward the altar.
