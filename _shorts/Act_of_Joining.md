## {{page.title}}

The very fact of listening regardless of what you hear makes it easier
for everyone else to listen as well. The very act of turning toward the
altar, the very fact of inquiring of the Holy Spirit or the Father or
me constitutes an act that everyone is a participant in whether they
realize it or not. And your simple act of turning to the father, with
inquiry, with curiosity, to know what will bring about healing, blesses
absolutely everyone.

It's the leaven that leavens the whole lump. It's the act of not
attempting to do anything from your separate sense of self. It's the
act of joining with one who is awake or with the father, that
constitutes the real blessing and blesses absolutely all of the
brotherhood, not just those on your planet. That's why it's the leaven
that leavens the whole lump.
