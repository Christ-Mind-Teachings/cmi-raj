for everyone else to listen as well. The very act of turning toward the
altar. The very fact of inquiring of the Holy Spirit or the Father or
me. Constitutes. An act That everyone is a participant in whether they
realize it or not. And your simple act of turning to the Father. With
inquiry, with curiosity. To know what will Bring about healing. blesses
absolutely everyone. It's the leaven that leavens the whole lump. It's
the act of not attempting to do anything. From your separate sense of
self. It's the act of joining. With one who is awake. Or with the
father. That constitutes the real blessing. And blesses absolutely all
of the brotherhood, not just those on your planet. That's why it's the
leaven that leavens the whole lump.
