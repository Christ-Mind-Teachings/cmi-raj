You all have thought. That your mind is the authorizer that it's not
there to be in service to anything. It is something for everyone else
and everything else to be in service too. Let's move this mountain.
Let's clear this forest. Let's transform the land. Let's do what will
damage the ozone layer just because we want to do it. After all, we
won't be here to suffer the consequences. Let's make our mark on the
earth. Let's make our mark on each other. Let's coerce each other into
being. What we want them to be or stop them from being what we don't
want them to be. And so everything Must become subject And in service to
the mind that has conceived the idea of how things ought to be. But
that's not the function of the mind. And as long as one insists upon
employing it that way, one is at odds with the way things work. And You
are going to exist in an ongoing state of suffering. which will be more
or less intense depending upon Whether you are more or less in harmony
with the way things work. It is insulting to the ego. To let the mind be
in service to the atonement. To be in service to the father's will, to
be in service to love.
