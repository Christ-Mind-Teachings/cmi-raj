been. And has been Not only waiting patiently, but because it's dominant
that it has doggedly. Insinuated itself through your defenses
persistently and consistently as long as you've stayed commitment to
your limits. And it's winning Even though it can't move you faster than
you will allow yourself to move. But that which is pushing you is your
