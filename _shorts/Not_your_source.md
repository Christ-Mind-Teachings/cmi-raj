The father is greater and always will be greater. You are not your
source. And never will be. But when you are no longer claiming A sense
of self separate from and independent from your source. Then your source
will be your constituting presence. God will be the presence and the
only presence right where you are. And it is not possible for you to
grasp experientially at this point the fact that you can still be you.
And you can experience each other distinctly. While at the same time,
Experiencing the fact that you are inseparably one. Then you might say
the two of you will do the dance, God is dancing. And you will appear to
cooperate with each other. You will appear to move intelligently with
each other. You will be with each other in exquisitely beautiful ways.
But not because you're expressing any independence from each other at
all or from God.
