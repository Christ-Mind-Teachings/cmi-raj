It's not give to get. It's give. Because that's your function. And when
you are fulfilling your function, you feel whole, and that's what you
get. Is the experience of feeling whole. You get fulfillment when
unselfishness is practiced, when you're not on your mind anymore. Then
you fulfilled will be on your mind.
