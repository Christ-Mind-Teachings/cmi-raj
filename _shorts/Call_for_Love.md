## {{page.title}}

Everything that's happening is either love or a call for love. So when
you see attack, What is really going on is a call for love. What is
really going on is a request. For someone to see that the fear that is
motivating the attack is invalid. And The desire To feel and know that
it is invalid. The behavior seems to call for defense. But what will
solve the problem of the apparent attack. Is a presence of fearlessness.
A presence of peace. The presence of love. That conveys one way or
another. That the behavior is not frightening. And therefore your
brother. It is not frightening. Even though he's behaving in a way. That
is attempting to engender fear.
