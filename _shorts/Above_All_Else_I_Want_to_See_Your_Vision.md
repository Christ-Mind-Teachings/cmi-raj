You say Father, God, whatever word you want to use. You say Father, stay
with me and help me be in this place. Help me not suddenly slip and
abandon you. Let me not forget about being joined with you. So that when
apparent challenges come my way I will stay with you and look at it
from this peace which is inseparable from our joining. So that I might
live through what comes up in ways that identify Peace and fulfillment
and nothing else. Because I really want to exist differently than the
way I have been existing.

Above all else I want to see differently. I want to see minus my
conditioned responses to what I see. I want to see beyond my best
judgments about everything. I want to see everything through your
vision. I want to see everything through your vision, Jesus, which is
your gift to me from God. Now, this is A little bit more intimate and
personal expression Of what you find in the book of John and the Bible.
That says, "Let that mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus."
It's more intimate and personal because you're saying to Jesus, I want
to see everything through your vision. Which is your gift to me from
God.

And I am asking you, I am encouraging you, I am inviting you to go
through your day every day with this attitude.

To risk the chance that if you actually were willing to join with Jesus
and see through Christ's vision, that war will end, that all kinds of
inharmony will end.

And I will be quiet now as you continued.

This is The divine event embodying the fullness of
the perfection of the love that God is being. That it is an awesome
event, that will be far from dull. That will be more satisfying than the
word satisfaction has ever meant to you before.

I love you. You are all Mightily supported. In your experience of the
atonement. Don't go through this week feeling that you're doing it all
by yourself. Let the experience of being actively loved, *In.*
