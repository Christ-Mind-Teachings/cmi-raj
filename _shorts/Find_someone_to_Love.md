awakening. Without finding someone to give to. And when you find someone
to give to, Then You ask within. What to give. Father Lead me in this
moment. And what you end up giving may just be the most wonderful smile
that person receives in the whole day. And it might be much more. But

result. Of inviting the father's perspective. Into your awareness. And

awareness is so that you may give it away. The desire to engage in an
act of love, the giving of love. is what opens the door for the Father's
love to shine through. And in the process of the gift being given, you
get blessed. Have an object of your affection. And ask the father. What
can I give? Let it be simple. The best thing you can do to contribute to
awakening is Find someone to love.
