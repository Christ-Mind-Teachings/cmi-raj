Prayer, as I've said before, is you saying, Father, what is your will?
It isn't saying, please give me this, please save my marriage. Hey God,
I'm over here. Here's what I need. Here's what I want. You say, Father,
what do I need? And then you shut up. And listen And be receptive and
stop resisting. How do you resist by saying, I should be able to figure
this out for myself. Or I should be able to determine. The manner in
which God will answer me. Prayer is saying help Listening, being
receptive, letting in so that revelation can occur. And you can more
clearly be the conscious presence of God being all there is right there
where you are. When you are awake Revelation God expressing Himself. God
expressing His will, God being all. will be your conscious experience of
being you. Not of you being all. But of you being God consciously being
all there is. Your conscious experience of being will be God's conscious
experience of being all. Revelation will not then seem to come to you.
It will be your conscious experience of being, period.
