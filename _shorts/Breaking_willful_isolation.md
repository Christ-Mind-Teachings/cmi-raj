## {{page.title}}

Having been willing to break the willful isolation and to have said. I
want to be with someone. I want to exist with someone instead of by
myself. I want to cooperate with someone instead of always doing things
alone, and I want to cooperate with someone, let me put it this way, if
indeed there is a reality beyond what I'm currently experiencing or more
of reality than I'm currently experiencing, then I want to be with. And
I want to cooperate with, and I want to join with one who sees it and
can help uncover it to me. I choose to be willing to yield to one who
knows more. I am willing to acknowledge that I don't know at all. I'm
willing to be The underdog and say I need help and mean it and not be
insulted by it.
