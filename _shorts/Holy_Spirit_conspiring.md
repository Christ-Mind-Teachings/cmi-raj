## {{page.title}}

The Holy Spirit is conspiring. To shorten the time. Your divinity. Held
in trust is conspiring. On your behalf. To shorten the time that you are
ignorant. And everything that I am doing has one goal. To bring about a
little bit of willingness. To be open and let it in. A little bit of
willingness to Let time collapse. By letting your confidences in your
Mutually agreed upon definitions. To collapse.
