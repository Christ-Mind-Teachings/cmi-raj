I'll give you a nudge and a support and a kick in the butt. But always
with love. And never in a way that will Discourage you truly. So that
you don't forget to be inquisitive. And you don't forget. To be open to
the fuller meaning of yourself. And I will do this until you remember
who you are, and the moment you remember who you are, together we will
rejoice. And I won't be your teacher. I will be your brother, your
full-fledged brother, whom you No intimately. Infinitely. And so
together we will experience our union. We will recognize ourselves in
each other. And then you might say we will learn of God. Because both of
us will be fully available to The movement of creation in its infinite
meanings. With none of it escaping our notice. And together we will be
able To stand in awe of The incredibleness of The movement of God that
we're not separate from in any way.
