It's more about you. Letting God use you. Or the Holy Spirit to use you.
Your readiness. is epitomized in the phrase thy will be done. Readiness
is when there is enough humility. To get out of the way as a healer.
Your willfulness is the opaqueness that doesn't let God through. The
more humility infuses itself into you and the more allowing you are of
it. The less opaque your mind becomes. And the more light that can shine
through. And what is the atonement? Yes. The act of love. And as we've
said, The only way An act of capital L love can occur. is when you
desire to have the father's love come through you. Not through you as
you, but through you. As the father's love still. And extending it.
Especially extending it to one who seems to you, your ego sense to be
unworthy of it. And in that willingness, That one is blessed and you are
blessed. The only way you can accept the atonement for yourself is to
extend it to your brother. You cannot sit in a room all by yourself and
be bathed in the light of God. So that you and you alone can soak up the
rays. And be blessed and tanned beautifully. The way you receive the
atonement. is by finding An object of your affection. Because it's your
function to be the presence of love. And then Say, Father Show this one
to me. Let me see your vision. Infill me. With the true Perception of
him or her.
