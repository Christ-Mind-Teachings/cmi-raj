As more and more of you are. Being the presence of love. Embodying The
revelation of reality that the Father is providing you with. The
population. The mind, you might say, of, of the population shifts as the
individuals shift, the population is identified in a new way. Not only
that, Because of the fact that the shift of your perception is impulsed
by God. And therefore embodies truth with a capital T. Then, because
there is no defensiveness in you in your consideration of The world that
God is revealing to you. And your love is not diluted by fear or anxiety
or hate or anything else. Your benignness becomes obvious to everyone
around you, and they feel safe with you whether you've said a word or
not to them. And the mood changes and the ripple extends, and it's
transformational. You see?
