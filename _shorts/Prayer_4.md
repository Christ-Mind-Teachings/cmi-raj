## {{page.title}}

I allow only. For that which expresses the Christ consciousness. And
only that which is in harmony with the purpose of being. The father's
will. In other words, thy will, not mine, be done. Let the reign of
divine truth, life, and love be established in me. And rule out of me
all self will. And may thy word enrich the affections of all mankind.
And govern them.
