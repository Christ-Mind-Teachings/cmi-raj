And so the father says, be still. Shut up! Silence your mind. Be still
and know that I am God. Not you. Be still and know that I am the Father
and you are the Son. Because this is how you remember who you are, which
is the essential first step to coming back home into your right mind. Be
still and know that I And the author. I am the source. And when you stop
trying to be an independent source of things, And let yourself back into
me. You will find your conscious experience of being. The experience of
Being the source. The experience of being The threshold Where conception
Moves into creation. You will find yourself having the full blown
conscious experience of being me. Which is your function. In other
words, you and I are one, and I am that one. It's important that this be
understood so that you might realize. That the process of awakening will
constitute the complete, complete, complete relinquishment. of any
authority you might have on your own. And yet that will not mean that
you will cease to be conscious of yourself as the father individualized.
Period. And remember that I have said before that The father
individualized. is universal and specific simultaneously.
