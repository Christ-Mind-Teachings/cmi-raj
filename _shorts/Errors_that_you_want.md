Truth cannot deal with errors that you want. I'm telling you that
there's an alternative. And I'm telling you that it's an alternative
worth reaching for. It's an alternative worth claiming. Because it's
your birthright. The only thing that stands in your way are your
misperceptions. Don't defend yourself against the surprise of
discovering truth more clearly. Just because you'd rather be in charge
yourself. All are called but few choose to listen. Listen is such an
important word because listening breaks isolation, doesn't it? If you
are listening, you're listening for something other than. The idle
chatter of your own mind and your own ego. It's an invitation to hear
something other than yourself. Such a simple thing. None of this at the
bottom line is difficult. You already know how to listen. You just
aren't choosing to, that's all.
