something that is far from a flight of fancy. That it's significant That
you will be changing. And growing. And that it's appropriate for it to
be graceful. Rather than frightening or difficult. So now you've been
given a little bit of a hint. That later on a more direct approach to
God is In the cards for you. It implies that that could be overwhelming.
And therefore Each step of the way has value in reducing your fear of
your good. But nevertheless, It's the Father's good pleasure to give you
the kingdom, and he's gifting you with it every single moment. And so I
want you to realized that A connection with God. can happen at any
moment that you're undefended against it. And it doesn't have to be way
down the road. God is love. And you don't need to be afraid of it. God
is appearing to you right now. Remember that when you look at your
brother, whether your brother. is consciously allowing The Christ
expression. Which is the Christ allowing God expression. realize that
this is at the bottom line. What your brother truly is. So that you're
not fooled by the presentation of ignorance that your brother or sister
