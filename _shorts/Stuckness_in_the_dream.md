A call for love calls for love to be embodied. So that What was
inhibiting the one calling for love from expressing and embodying love
himself. Can dissolve And free that one up to embody love. Instead of a
call for love, instead of needing love to be able to extend love. So
let's be very clear. It's all about correction occurring. And until
correction has occurred, You're still in the dream. And if you don't
even think correction is called for, you're stuck in the dream. And your
stuckness contributes to the stuckness of your brothers and sisters as
well. Because you don't do any of this all by yourself.
