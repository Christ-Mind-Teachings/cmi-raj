## {{page.title}}

In whatever way you can, you persist to witness for the truth for them.
And you continue to let it be known that you are willing to stand with
them on their behalf. Toe to toe on the line. Privately between them or
with them in front of others. On behalf of that which will transform
their lives, heal them. And if they say no, in no uncertain terms, or if
they say no in very caustic terms, You say, OK, With perfect willingness
in the next 3 minutes to make the offer again. For the next 6, in other
words, You say OK, but you don't drop it. You don't drop the
willingness. You don't react in a way that would cause you to withhold
your willingness. You let it be what it is, you say, OK, with immediate
ongoing willingness to Offer your willingness again. I, I didn't say it
wasn't work. I've used the word work relative to this. You must persist.
And persist Very often in the face of resistance and refusal to accept.
But you know what, you want to be there. With your willingness active,
the moment there's the slightest curiosity or the slightest opening. And
if you're indulging in reaction, you may miss it. And you won't be
standing there ready to witness for them on their behalf.
