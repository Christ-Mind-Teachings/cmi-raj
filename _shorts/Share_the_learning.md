I cannot forget my need to teach what I have learned. Which arose in me
because I learned it. What is it that arose? My need to teach what I
have learned. Why? Because in order to have the learning, you must share
it. If you keep it private and do not share it and do not connect with
your brother, you don't demonstrate your oneness and you are still as
asleep as you ever were.
