 uh imagination. And so I'm willing to be in the place where I am
 nothing all by myself. I will abandon being the orphan. That is
 nothing. And I invite my father back into the picture. Father, help me.
 Father, revealed to me. The knowing Or as uses the word in the course,
 the knowledge. That reveals Truth and perfection and reality to me.
 Fill me today with all thou art. I'm willing to take my place as your
 son or daughter. I'm willing to take my place as your offspring.
 Reflecting you. And I will stop using relationships for purposes of
 control, which is not what they were for. And I will care enough about
 my brother. That I will hold him guiltless because I'm willing to
 acknowledge that right where he is, you, Father, must be. If you
 weren't there, there couldn't seem to be anything there at all. And so
 I'm willing to bless him. Rather than cursing with my judgment and
 projecting guilt on him. I'm through feeling the dissonance of my
 daring to think. I withdraw my willingness to project my discomfort
 caused by my thinking upon my brother and making him guilty for it and
 trying to prove it to him so that I can make him change his behavior.
 So that I can feel better. I am going to choose to abandon the
 thinking, which is the culprit. And go into that place. Of silence
 within me. To the altar in a little gap between memory. And imagination
 This does not have to take a long time. You can just stop outside the
 post office. And bless those who walk past you. As long as you're so
 sure that you know who your brother and sister really is. The bastard
 or bitch that they are, or the ignorant one or the black one or the One
 who isn't so intelligent or the cranky one. When you approach your
 brother. With that mindset, You're not approaching your brother at all.
 You're approaching. The picture you have in your mind of them. And
 you're avoiding actual experience with them. And so the function for
 which a relationship exists will escape you entirely because you're
 blocking the relationship from registering with you. Now, The reason
 you approach each other in this fashion. is because you want to be
 right. And you want to be right because you want to have authority and
 power. And you think you can't have that. If you're not in charge. And
 if you don't get agreement with your brother, Or sister By means of
 control. And so you never become defenseless with your brother or
 sister. Defenseless with your brother or sister means. Being willing to
 be. Unguardedly present with them. So that connection can occur. And
 the blessing of what a real relationship is for can be your experience.
 Guilt will disappear. And its effects will disappear. When you are
 willing to be defenselessly present with your brother. or sister. But
 you won't be able to be defenselessly present with your brother or
 sister. Until you've cared enough about your brother or sister. To
 abandon your preconceptions about him or her. And your brothers and
 sisters' conceptions about himself or herself. And you're willing to
 step back a moment and say, what is the truth here, Father? Reveal to
 me. Reveal yourself to me in them. Help me to see you in them. So that
 I might look at them and remember you, which is my function. The reason
 out of all the possible things that, that you could do, the reason that
 this one thing is your function is because it's the way you come back
 home. It's the way You slip into the little gap. And I'll tell you that
 as long as you're dreaming, everything that confronts you is geared
 toward. You're waking up. Everything is the opportunity for you to do
 the two-step. You are your brother's salvation and your brother is your
 salvation. Now, It's time To lay guilt aside. I know. Many of you like
 the place in the course, where it says that a time will come when you
 will lay your body aside. The visibility and tangibility Of God. The
 visibility and tangibility of creation will never be laid aside. What
 will be laid aside is the intent that each of you thinks you have to
 carry out. To have false definitions about all of creation. And you
 will lay those aside. Now, I am saying Have a great reverence for. The
 idea of laying guilt aside. Let it die. Let it, let it go. You can do
 it today. How? Not by doing anything to it. And not by trying to
 improve your thinking. But by abandoning thinking itself. And going
 into the silence and listening. And one of the best ways to silence
 judgment. is by engaging in The practice of blessing your brothers and
 sisters. Do it. All week long. Do it, do it, do it. Do it. It will
 transform you. Why? Because you're thinking something right? No.
 Because you're abandoning judgment. Because you're silencing. A
 fraudulent mindset. And because you want. To come home. I thank you for
 your attention. And I ask you to bring your attention. All week long.
 Into the little gap. No matter what you're doing. That the dishes
 you're washing. Bless the opportunity to be cleaning something. Bless
 your brothers and sisters. And bless yourselves. The movement of love.
 Is the movement of creation. Engage in it. Rather than the practice or
 the valuing of guilt.
