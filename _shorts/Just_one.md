## {{page.title}}

One with God is a majority. It really only takes one to be clear. An
illusion equals 0. So you can put a million zeros together and they all
add up to 0, even though they seem to have what you might call mass or
size or take up a certain amount of space. Overcoming nothing is no
problem. And it only takes one to see that it's nothing. For one reason
or another, something happens in them that allows them to overlook the
costume. Meaning the apparent circumstances. And see through it to the
truth. And The behavior of a child. It's not impossible. Don't, don't
use your mind to create. An overwhelming image. That says, well, it must
take more than one person. Finding his or her center. And being open to
the influx of God's perspective. And his love, it doesn't. It just takes
one.
