You have no idea. The extent to which and the infinite amount of
compassion and support. is extended to you. Great illumination. embraces
you. You do not always feel. This compassionate, loving embrace, but it
is there and it does slowly penetrate. And it does slowly lift you out
of it to a point where You are willing to abandon some of your
commitment to the awfulness of your current sense of yourself, and then
your upliftment can happen much more rapidly.
