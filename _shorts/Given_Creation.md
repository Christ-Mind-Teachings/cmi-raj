## {{page.title}}

God has given you all that he is. God has given you. Creation Because
he, what he is, is fully embodied in you as you. And Isn't it
interesting? That you're believing that. And making commitment to it.
Brings you everlasting life. As long as you're Having some belief other
than that, some belief of your own creation. You cause yourself to
become blinded to your everlasting life. Your eternality, your
indestructibility. Your permanence. Just because you've chosen to honor
a belief of your own making. And you've joined with someone else in it.
In a mutually agreed upon definition.
