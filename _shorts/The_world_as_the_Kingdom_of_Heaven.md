I have said that any changes, earth changes that occur will be evidences
of healing. And will therefore be greater and greater evidences of
harmony. So Do not buy into the Great hanging that is going on. I
encourage you. To look at this world. With the curiosity to see it for
what it really is, which is the kingdom of heaven. Love it by not
projecting upon it your fears. It's just like your body. You don't want
to project on it distrust. That it on its own can act at odds with you
and not in your best interests. That's not love, that's hate. Your body
is the visibility and tangibility of your individuality, and your
individuality is the presence of God. I didn't see your ego was your
individuality is the presence of God. Therefore, great appreciation and
honoring and respect needs to be expressed by you or embraced by you
relative to your body, and the same thing with your world, because the
only way you're going to see your body as it divinely is and the only
way you're going to see the kingdom of heaven. That you're currently
calling the world. As the kingdom of heaven is when you are looking to
see the kingdom of heaven there instead of some prediction coming true.
You see?
