From that place that you arrive at as a result of meditating. You are
primed for being able to easily hear the answer when you ask God, what
is it appropriate for me to do? What is your viewpoint of this? In the
quietness that one comes to as a result of meditating. The defenses that
get in the way or create the static that makes it difficult to hear your
guidance. It's so reduced. It's so much less. When you have meditated
that hearing is easier and establishing the connection is easier. Each
one of you is worth 20 minutes twice a day. To disregard everything else
and sit down and become still. Every one of you is worth 40 minutes out
of your day where you're not taking care of somebody else. OK.
