You can say very practically. I am able to recognize. Because at the
bottom line, I know it's true about me. That I am more than my thoughts.
And I am more than my beliefs. Because my beliefs can change. But I
don't. Therefore, because I am not my beliefs. My beliefs and their
results cannot identify me. Because I see that about myself. I can look
at my brother and reason clearly. That he is not his beliefs. And he
doesn't deserve the suffering he is experiencing from his beliefs.
Therefore, I see them separate. I am able to make a distinction between
the two, and on the basis of that distinction, I choose to ask God how
to be with the unchangeable Christ that is there so that he might be.
Released from suffering beliefs. That he thinks he's the believer of
Together with his freedom from his belief that he's the believer of
them. And then Having Acknowledged what I just said. You turn to the
father. And say Fill me. With love, fill me with your vision. Fill me
with your perspective. So that I might be overflowingly filled with it.
And my brother is blessed, the Christ that is standing there. Show me
how to be with him. And if His A sudden shift of perception isn't
instantaneous. Help me To keep my attention on the Christ that he is
while we be together. In A lovingly educational healing process.
