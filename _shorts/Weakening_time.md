## {{page.title}}

Every single time you have the experience of the miracle of a sudden
shift of perception. That causes you by virtue of an unplanned clarity
to be in a place. That you otherwise know it would have taken a great
deal of time for you to get to through reasoning and working on
yourself, etc. Every time you have that kind of experience. It tells you
That you don't have to depend on time for anything. In other words, it
helps weaken your reliance on time as the solution to your problems, and
it relieves you of the idea. That it must necessarily take you a long
time. To accomplish a lot. Because to whatever degree you have a
commitment to it taking a long time because you believe it must take a
long time. You are providing resistance. To an instantaneous healing. To
a sudden shift of perception. To the miracle, you see. So every time you
have this experience of the miracle. It weakens your reliance on time,
your faith in time. And your bondage to time. And this in itself helps
precipitate the further breakdown. Of the idea that you exist in time
and that time governs your progress. And this is wonderful.
