I will witness for anyone who lets me. And to whatever extent he permits
it. You must give permission. You can't be dragged into the kingdom of
heaven. You must invite clarification. You must invite the
companionship, and you must let it in. Don't be afraid of the darkness.
The darkness within you. It seems a scary place. The ego needs for you
to be frightened of the place where you've hidden the truth about
yourself. But don't be frightened of it. And don't be afraid to go
there. And don't be afraid to let yourself be present in it. Because the
darkness is not a presence. It's just a place where you are consciously
refusing to let the light of your awareness shine on. The essential
truth that is your salvation. And the essential truth that is your
salvation that the ego. insists upon covering up is that you have no
personal, private, independent competence of any kind. And with that
Utter clarity We will end for tonight.
