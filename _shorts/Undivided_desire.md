When a desire. For that which represents truth and God and life. becomes
undivided. As I said, The desire becomes fulfilled spontaneously. Which
is another reason that I have been addressing everyone's willingness or
the need for everyone to be willing to become involved to the point of
saying no where no needs to be said and yes where yes needs to be said.
So on private thoughts. Your own private commitment because there are no
private thoughts. Do join on behalf of healing. And you know what the
potential for redemption. your focus of attention needs to be on.
Healing Transformation Regeneration, redemption. If healing is the goal.
Then every aspect of the means of Arriving at the healing. will reflect
and embody that goal.
