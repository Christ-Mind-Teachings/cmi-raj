The current mindset in the world is to accumulate power and wealth seems
to be one of the most effective means of influencing others. To allow
power. To be exercised over them. Someone somewhere. Like maybe you. Can
Abandon that game, abandon that mindset. And start being The presence of
love. The gifter instead of the getter. That what is done with money,
embrace and gift. With no strings. That everything that is done with
money bless. Not you. But those to whom You would extend your love. Not
your love, but the love that arises in you. When you have turned around
toward the altar and been filled. By the love that is in it.
