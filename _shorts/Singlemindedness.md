What is the atonement? An act of love. So when you do this, you make a
gift. To everyone and everything. Because your mind becomes single.
Without distractions. Without confusions. And in that singleness. In
that single-mindedness. In that purity. In the awareness of what truth
is. You you spontaneously and effortlessly and without. Conscious design
become a beacon of light, a presence of Love That blesses absolutely
everyone, not just on your globe, but the whole brotherhood, those who
are awake as well as those who are still dreaming dreams.
