That's your task to find a way to take the cloak off. The undefiled,
unaltered direct expression of God. So that you can actually Love And
then turned to God. And say, God, fill me with the love. So that it
fills me so full it overflows. And blesses everyone. This isn't you
using your mind to make something happen. This is you letting God use
your mind to make something happen. And that's why you turn toward the
altar, because you don't know how to use your mind to make something
happen. Why? Because the you you think you are at the moment. is a 3
dimensional object, and the 3rd dimension is not where cause arises.
That's why you turned toward the altar so that God can move through you.
So that God can use your mind. To find expression. In the dream And
thereby dissolve the dream.
