## {{page.title}}

All of your attempts to be in control, all of them are expressions of
lack of love because all of them are in the service of your denying your
conscious awareness of yourself, who you really are. It is an act of
aggression against yourself. Ultimately, it's an act of aggression
against God. Because what's being covered up in the darkness. Is the
presence of God being all there is of you? Now it doesn't mean that God
is being abused because all of this is going on in the imagination. It's
not really happening and no matter how long you have spent. Attempting
to get to the top of the barrel and stay there, you never for a moment
had any competency or any existence as a separated entity capable of
rising to the top of the barrel and staying there. As long as there is
an attempt to move vertically, it is lonely. No matter where you are
between the bottom and the top of the barrel. It's lonely by definition
because you have said in so many words. I'd rather see it my way. I
choose to fool myself into believing that I can be independent and have
an independent viewpoint. That's the definition of being alone.
Therefore, everything that follows will be um. Imbued with loneliness.
