and in this state of mind. Your very being is expressing the meaning of
the statement thy will be done. Father And you're in a state of
listening, in a state of Union in a state of communion with God. Which
is your natural state of being. It's the only state of being you have.
From there, Because of your union. And because of your yielding to the
Father's will. His will becomes yours. And you act. Out The presence of
God, you embody God. You give expression to God. And when you begin to
do that, As you are waking up, the result is what is called a miracle. A
sudden shift of perception. In you That causes you to behave in a new
way, embody in a new way. What is embodied. Will be cohesive, will be
unified. Perfect. Lovely. Harmonizing Everything you do will fit into
The wholeness of creation. As an integral part of the wholeness of
creation. And you will see the happy dream begin to be manifested in the
world. Again, the key lies in Daring to consider the possibility that
you are not self-created. And that you are not what you have. Come to

and come to conclusions. You are not self-created. Your existence is
entirely God derived.
