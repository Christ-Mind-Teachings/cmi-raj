I just want to end. With the remembrance that Independence is more than
anything a gift you give to others. As well as being a gift you give
yourself. You must release others. From the concepts you are holding
them to in your mind. And you must release yourselves from the concepts
you hold yourself hostage to. Independence is more importantly a gift
than a possession. And that's where it's at. And that's what needs to be
remembered. And that's what needs to be embodied. And at the bottom
line, Releasing your hostages. Is the meaning of forgiveness. And as
each of you does it, I can only convey it this way. It is as though you
will find yourself supported by Thousands of angels. When you release
hostages. You are blessed. Supported And that's what I want you to
remember from this weekend.
