## {{page.title}}

If you will imagine that you're a puppet. Hanging from the strings that
the father is holding. You will know exactly where you stand in reality.
But when you let yourself be, The puppet of God, the expression of God.
And you're not attempting to introduce any original movements. As a A
puppet without strings. Then you will find that your cooperation with
the way the father is moving you amounts to what is called co-creation.
When you are yielding to what the Father is being right where you are.
You are joined with the Father in His being of you. And his being of
you, being of you. It is always relative to every aspect of the infinity
of creation. Which means that you're yielding. To his being all there is
of you. We will bring you into a full conscious awareness of creation
infinitely and your Absolute inseparability from it. An experience of
wholeness.
