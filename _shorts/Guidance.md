Guidance is an expression of love. And it's always expressing. The
Father's will for you. And because you're not truly separated from any
aspect of creation, infinitely speaking, Then Guidance is always A
blessing to everyone and everything. The guidance you receive. We'll
never have disruption and failure as its goal in your life. But greater
harmony. and greater fulfillment. And so it will not overwhelm you and
it will not overwhelm your family. If anything Your family will perceive
you to be a more loving person. A more benign person. Not a wimp. But
non-threatening. You don't need to be afraid. That disruption is going
to be the result. And so I want to make it perfectly clear that the love
with which you are embraced by your guide. And by the Father. And that
the function and purpose of this love is to reveal greater and greater
harmony and more and more fulfillment. How could fulfillment be
fulfillment? If it estranged you. From your world It couldn't and it
can't. So let go of the fear. You can even ask your guide to be gentle
with you. That is the nature of the love with which you are held at
every moment. And Imagine if you will, that if you let yourself feel
that. It couldn't help but ooze out of you. In a way that made those
around you feel more beautiful.
