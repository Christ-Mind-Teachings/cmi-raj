Your attention needs to be brought to The center of your being. The
inner quietness. All you have to do I be willing To not be separate
anymore. And the moment you make that Joining With The presence of God
in the middle of you. Then You will find you're invulnerable. And that
there is no fear and that there never was. So again, it's not something
that happened in the past. It's a change of mind that occurred. Which
can be unchanged at any moment. Abandon your imagined capacity to stand
separate. And objectively view. The subject of experience of being love
itself. The only effective defense. Against an illusion. is to stop
indulging in the illusion. And because you can't actually become
something you're not, you never did become something that had that
capacity. And so that fact. That you have never changed one iota for 1
2nd. From what God created you to be. Is the answer that's already in
place in the middle of you because it was never undone. It is already
there. For perfect effectiveness, it is already there. The point is that
that's where you need to bring your attention.
