## {{page.title}}

To be for or against something, you've got to have your back to the
altar and your for or against definitions have to relate to everything
you see. Without the father's perspective available to you. There's a
third alternative. You can either be for or against something, or you
can be with. God With the father. Now we're not talking about for or
against. And when you're standing with the Father, Everything you be.
will never be able to be successfully defined as attack. Even though
those with their backs still to their altars. We see your definiteness.
As a judgment upon them.
