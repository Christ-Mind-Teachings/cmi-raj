Miracles that you performed that I did not ask you to perform. have not
lost their value. They are still expressions of your own state of grace.
But the action aspect of the miracle should be controlled by me because
of my complete awareness of the whole plan. As you allow me to select.
The place for miracles to happen. You will, as if by osmosis. Begin to
feel. Why the selection was made. But it is only through a continued
yielding to my guidance. Where the opportunity for this experience to
occur can happen over and over and over again only in this way. Can you
learn? How to distinguish where the miracle is to be extended. So I
encourage you. Not to Not to decide where a miracle is needed. Very
often Because that will deprive you. Of the opportunity to wordlessly
and thoughtlessly. Feel, begin to feel and thereby learn. When and where
a miracle is to occur.
