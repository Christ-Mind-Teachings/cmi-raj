In addition, To remembering to love your neighbor. To Find even more
value. In turning toward the altar. So that God might give you the
vision of your brother. That is a vision of love that will spontaneously
result in behavior that will identify God's vision and purpose rather
than a practical and intelligent. And Humanly beneficial practice.
That's where the real joy is. You get good feelings from remembering to
love your brother and doing it and seeing that it has a better result
than misbehaving with your brother. Uh, but the joy comes from The
undeniable experience of God's presence in the whole thing. That's what
I'm homing in on here is the experience. And I'm homing in on your
rolling up your sleeves and engaging in the work. Where the call is Most
strenuous. It is the place where it is most needed and it is the place
where when the love is gifted. The most transformation can occur.
