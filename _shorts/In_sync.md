Before miracle workers are ready to undertake their function in this
world. It is essential that they fully understand the fear of release.
And why would you fear that? Why would you fear the release from that?
Might it be the release from The mutually agreed upon definitions that
gave you such a sense of wonderful security and well-being. That's a
pretty scary thing. When you have gathered your sense of your well-being
from everyone else's. Good thoughts about you. Because that's where your
sense of strength had come from. None of you are used to the experience
of strength that is derived from Being perfectly in sync with the way
things work, perfectly in sync with the father. Perfectly in sync with
that which is fundamentally divine about you. In sync with your
function. So It is a fearful thing. To be released from Everyone's well
wishes for you. Everyone else's positive assessment of you. Positive
because you weren't challenging. Their point of view by functioning. In
any way unique. Or In any way at odds with Their assessment of The
behavior that makes them feel safe and strong, you see. To be in sync
with yourself. is inseparable from An incredible Awesome experience of
peace. In vulnerability. And joy That's the fact.
