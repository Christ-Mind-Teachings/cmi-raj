Thank you. I acknowledge you. I appreciate you. Poor being. My brothers
and sisters. I want you to know that you need to know that. Oh, you
know, Jesus loves you. Well, of course, Jesus loves you. He's Jesus. I
don't love you because I'm Jesus. I love you just because, and you love
me just because, and you love each other just because. And the sooner
you realize that that's the only way you can love each other, you'll get
rid of all this manipulative chicken shit control that gets in the way
of your joy. And the harmony that you can be enjoying with each other.
