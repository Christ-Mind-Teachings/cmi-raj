## {{page.title}}

When you become still, what you're doing is making room for God. And
then there is an infilling that occurs. First is the experience of
peace, and then is the experience of feeling. Loved And then an
accompanying joy. Those influxes of the presence of God experienced by
you. are themselves the impulse of the messengers that are being sent
out, and they are the messengers that will return to you with
confirmation. Just being in the quietness does not send a messenger out.
You're not in the quietness waiting for a messenger to return. You are
in the quietness. Waiting upon God. Waiting upon the Holy Spirit. To
infill you. Because It is their purpose to uncover to you what is true
about you. which you can only recognize within yourself when you have
abandoned. Assertive, authoritative, aggressive thinking.
