It's very important for all of you to understand that in order for the
ego to secure its existence, it has to keep you preoccupied from
experiencing your wholeness with God. And therefore, it will tell you
that you will experience significant loss if you succumb to joining with
God. Well, it's the ego that will experience significant loss and be
extinct forever, not you. Absolutely everybody is afraid. To Be one with
God. Just contemplate that. And understand That this is the technique
the ego uses. To Keep you from waking up. And to keep it alive and
healthy.
