It's, it's kind. Not to wake up suddenly. There would be an experience
of discontinuity of identity. One moment you would be yourself as you're
experiencing yourself right now, and the next moment, the experience
would be so radically different. That you would not be able to connect
the two. You would not be able To Have the essential experience. Of
knowing that the you I spoke of earlier that's very small at the moment,
but is absolutely real, is the same you that you are when your
experience is an infinite experience of you. And that is exactly why you
have to start where you are honoring. That which is essential and real
about you right now to let the expansion occur, so there is no
discontinuity of the experience of identity. To have that discontinuity
would constitute uh another form of insanity. It can't happen. But you
can allow it to happen faster. By inviting it, by being curious. To To
see more of what is real, right in front of you since some guy called
Raj has told you that it's really the kingdom of heaven. You can speed
it up by not resisting it as strongly, you see.
