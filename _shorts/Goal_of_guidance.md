If you want to contribute to the work, unquote, you will persist in
listening within to guidance and live your life from the wisdom that you
experience there and Shall I say cope with The stretching That such
listening imposes upon you. Because indeed, Guidance is not
entertainment. Guidance has a goal, and that is to uh bring you back
into your right mind, to break down perceptions and beliefs and uh
commitments that you have made that block you from experiencing yourself
wholly W H O L L Y. And so it is a stretching experience. That is what
all of you can do. To help and in effect what you're doing is you're
helping the whole brotherhood to come back into the fully conscious
experience of its wholeness with communion available and occurring
between all of The sons and daughters of God.
