This is an absolute fact. You respond to what you perceive. And if
you're not perceiving what's really going on, Then You respond in a way
that is inconsistent with reality. And you will bump your knee or your
shins or stub your toe against reality. But if, if you are Experiencing
the truth and you could say you are perceiving reality. And you will
respond to it as what it is. And as I said earlier, The way things work
begins. To be what works in your life. As I said, When you are willing
To let the father's view register with you about your brother. And you
see your brother, uh, and a miracle occurs, a shift in perception
occurs, so you see your brother truly. You learn that the truth about
them is the truth about yourself. And so your perception about them that
you have extended to them. Becomes your perception of yourself. You are
not a benefactor better than your brother, extending to your brother
something he doesn't have. You are both equal and you are both equal in
your conscious experience of what you both really are.
