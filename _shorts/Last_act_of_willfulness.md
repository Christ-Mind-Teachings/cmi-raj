What you think is what you find reflected in your world. So it's
extremely important what you think. Now, curiously enough, One of the
best thoughts you can have is That what you think a thing is. It is not
what it is. One of the best thoughts you can think is a thought that
undoes the value of thinking. It's like I've said before. The right use
of will is to choose not to use it. So your last act of willfulness. is
one of choosing to no longer employ willfulness. Likewise, the best
thought you can think is the one that undoes your valuing of thinking.
Why? So that you might be in a position to say thy will be done. So that
you might be in a position to let me. Control everything that doesn't
matter. So that you might be The perfect receptor. Of the fullness of
what God is being right there where you are as you. So that you might
come back into your right mind. And consciously. Participate or
cooperate in being. What God is being right there where you are.
