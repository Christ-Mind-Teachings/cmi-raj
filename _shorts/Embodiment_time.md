Whether you see the integrity and the presence of the kingdom of heaven
or not is up to you. And it will be a profound experience for all of you
to be experiencing the world and universe as the kingdom of heaven. So
you have not a daunting task in front of you, but a wonderful task that
it's your birthright. To experience in which you have the innate
capacity to embody. But we're down to the embodiment time. We're out of
the head trip time. We're out of, out of the wonderful ideas in a course
in miracles, and into the practical transformational, experiential
meaning of those words.
