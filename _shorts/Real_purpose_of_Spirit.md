Turning to the altar. Abandoning your will in favor of the Father's
will. Constitutes a uniting. A reuniting of that which never ever
actually became separate. And you naturally will remember when you do
that spirit, not matter. And its real purpose. And the real purpose of
spirit. is to give Recognizability. To the movement of mind that is God
being all.
