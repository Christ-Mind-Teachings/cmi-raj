In yielding to the river floating on your back, expending no energy
whatsoever for survival or the achievement of goals one. has abandoned
The so-called right to make evaluations. You can't even say, well, I'd
like to be closer to the edge of the river. Or I'd like to be in a
quieter part of the river. Or I'd like to be in a faster part of the
river. One has arrived at a point of saying, Thy will be done. I will
fit in. Those are the terrible words I will fit in. I yield To the
movement of creation. And hold myself separate from it no longer. And in
doing that, Abandoning this apparent right to be separate. You find
yourself at one with it and it being the wholeness of you.
