This is a very key point. It's like if you have a telephone. You're
likely to get a telephone call. Does that make sense? When there is a
willingness to hear, you are likely to hear something. Miracles are
selected only in the sense that they are directed towards those who can
use them for themselves. You might say those who are receptive to the
experience.
