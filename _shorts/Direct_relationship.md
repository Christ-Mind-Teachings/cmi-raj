## {{page.title}}

It really is helpful if you believe that I really do exist. And it
really does help. If in addition to believing that I exist, you are
willing to believe that I am available to you directly in your mind. And
that it's my desire. To commune with you directly, to have a direct
relationship with you. So that if you wish, You may shift your
allegiance. Ever increasingly hopefully from your ego to me. So that I
might let you lean upon me, so that you might get the feel of the
movement of being from a different vantage point than the one you've
been engaged in. Which has been one of fear and self-protection.
