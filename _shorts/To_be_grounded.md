The more grounded you are, or even The more firmly your feet are placed
on the surfboard. Means that you will have a smoother ride. A more
fulfilling ride. To be grounded does not mean To lose your ability to
soar. To be grounded does not mean That you've lost the ability to
explore. And all that we've been talking about today has to do with just
exactly that. So that no one gets caught up in lofty metaphysical or
spiritual concepts to the point where They are not relevant. To the
arena in which love is to be brought, expressed. And the arena in which
miracles occur. The things of spirit find evidence, find manifestation.
Right here where you are and right in your relationships with each
other.
