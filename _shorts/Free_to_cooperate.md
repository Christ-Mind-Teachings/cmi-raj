## {{page.title}}

You could say that you have free will. To try to stretch God. Or twist
him into something he isn't. But because he can't be twisted into
something he isn't. You will inevitably come to the realization that
what you're attempting to do is impossible and with understanding. And
with comprehension. And with willingness, you'll stop trying to do the
impossible. So the end is inevitable. Free will means that you have the
right. To cooperate with the way things work. But it also means That you
have to cooperate with the way things work because it's your choice.
