You all have to come to the point. Where you look at the world. You look
at your environment. You look at your brothers and sisters. You look at
your country and other countries. And you find some place in yourself.
I'm going to put it this way first, to be dedicated to what it all could
be. The second way I'm going to say it is To find a way to become
dedicated to what it truly is already. Because it already all is God
appearing. And your function is To witness for God. To glorify God in
each and everything because Somewhere in you it's dawning on you that
God is all there is to you and to everything you're experiencing. And
that the only thing that's keeping any of you from experiencing it is
the definition you're giving. And the definition that you're holding to
with all your mind.
