I am content to be wherever he wishes. Uh, it is sort of amusing, isn't
it? Um. It's really foolish not to be content. With being wherever the
father is being you. Do you have any other choice than to be where he is
beating you? I am content to be wherever he wishes, knowing he goes
there with me. You could say knowing he goes me there. Which means
you're not alone. I will be healed as I let him teach me to heal. Yes.
Do you see this is all literal. It's all wonderfully literal.
