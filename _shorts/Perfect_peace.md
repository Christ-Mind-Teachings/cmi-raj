Perfect peace is you. Experiencing no self-consciousness. You
experiencing no fear. You experiencing no vulnerability. You Not caring.
Whether others have judgments. Of you, on you. And in that space. You
find yourself being completely undefended. In being completely
undefended. There is no Inclination To assert yourself in any way. And
It's like floating on your back in a river. Where No energy needs to be
expended. For survival Or to achieve a goal. And when you find yourself
floating in a river. You find nothing static about your life. Because
the current of the river. is moving you and you are letting yourself be
at one with it. That means that you will find yourself functioning in
the world, unquote. Busy Active But not busy or active achieving
personal goals. Things you have made up. To accomplish. And when that
happens, You will find yourself. By virtue of having abandoned yourself
to the movement of being. Reflecting the father's will, embodying the
father's will. And thus everything you find yourself doing. will have
real meaning with a capital M. That for lack of better words will
glorify God in the world. Embodying His purpose And blessing everyone.
