I tell you what, You just try to sit down. And to be still And yield the
Father's will. And See if you can remain unmoving. See if you can avoid.
Breaking into dance, if you will, because of the joy that fills you. And
the movement of God and the rhythm of God and the beat of God and the
movement of creation. That is what you're the presence of, because God
is being all there is of you right now. And just see if you can keep
from doing something. It's a natural effortless flow of the movement of
fulfillment, making all things new. It's just that What you're doing
isn't done for your private purposes, and it isn't done for your gain,
it's a gift.
