This state of comfort. that you and your country have experienced is the
good news. That needs to be shared. The fact that you feel a right to
it. And that you're not apologetic for it and you're not ashamed for it.
Is the experience that is everyone's birthright to have. And if you're
not extending it when you have it. Then you are withholding it. And
those who do not have it cannot help but either be jealous of it or
angry at you. For not extending it. And so this is where accountability
comes in. Each one of you is accountable for not withholding the good
news, not withholding the freedom that you feel it's your birthright to
be experiencing to others. You are accountable for seeing to it that
those who represent you in your government are engaged in doing that
rather than being engaged in. Political maneuvers, leveraging. That does
not Increase The light in the candles that everybody in the other
countries are holding. The playing field has to be level. Where everyone
is experiencing the right that you unquestionably hold and feel to be
dealt with with respect. And if everyone isn't working to level that
playing field. Then Without dying and going to heaven and standing at
the judgment gates, your accountability comes into play right here.
