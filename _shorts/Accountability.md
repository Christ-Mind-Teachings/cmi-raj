This state of comfort that you and your country have experienced is the
good news that needs to be shared. The fact that you feel a right to
it and that you're not apologetic for it and you're not ashamed for it
is the experience that is everyone's birthright to have. And if you're
not extending it, when you have it, then you are withholding it. And
those who do not have it cannot help but either be jealous of it or
angry at you for not extending it.

And so this is where accountability comes in. Each one of you is
accountable for not withholding the good news, not withholding the
freedom that you feel it's your birthright to be experiencing to others.
You are accountable for seeing to it that those who represent you in
your government are engaged in doing that rather than being engaged in
political maneuvers, leveraging, that does *not* increase the light in the
candles that everybody in the other countries are holding.

The playing field has to be level. Where everyone is experiencing the
right that you unquestionably hold and feel to be dealt with with
respect. And if everyone isn't working to level that playing field then
without dying and going to heaven and standing at the judgment gates,
your accountability comes into play right here.
