It isn't all that awesome to you for me to love you. The way I'm
describing. It's not all that awesome for you to believe that all of
those who are awake love you in this way. What is awesome. It is for
each of you to love each other that way. That is what is awesome to you.
You have no idea the impact. That A brother who's speaking the same
language of illusion, we'll say, uh, a brother who is in the same dream
that you are. Expressing this kind of love. To you That It is awesome.
All of you, you could say, have a more awesome. Job or a more awesome
opportunity for transformation in the world than I do or than any of us
who are awake do. Because we're not violating an agreement. We're being
the way you expect us to be. It's, it's when the dream, the mutual
agreement of the dream is violated by love. That's what's awesome. Don't
underestimate your role in this.
