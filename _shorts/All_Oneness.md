## {{page.title}}

In the aloneness of your being. Of your being with a capital B. You
experience the all oneness of it, the wholeness of it. When you don't
resist it. Hunger for appreciation and acknowledgement from others.
Keeps you small. Because Feeling appreciated is something. You cannot
have without everyone else giving it to you. to feel loved. is something
you can't have without everyone else giving it to you. And yet You are
the expression at this moment and every moment, the ongoing,
uninterrupted, brand new expression of God. Which is an expression of
love, your very being. I love your very being is imbued with the love
the Father is imbuing it with. And literally the only real experience
you have available to you is the experience of being loved. And of being
loved.
