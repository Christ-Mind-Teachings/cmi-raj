The disowned part of you is called the Holy Spirit, which is always
taking every opportunity it can. To turn your current limited
perception. Into a better perception. And thus turning every situation
to your advantage. Stay on the leading edge of the wave of the movement
of creation. So that as the behold I make all things new, unquote.
Continues Eternally you are present for the fullness. of what God is
being. As the knowing of it. So that the experience of knowing is ever
fresh. In this sense, knowledge can never be applied to the past.
Knowledge cannot be acquired and saved. Knowledge is the direct now
experience of the movement of creation that God is being and that you
are inseparable from.
