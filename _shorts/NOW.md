The time is now because you have let it be now. You cannot learn except
by teaching. I heard one voice. Because I had learned that learning is
attained by teaching. And I learned that I couldn't be the teacher. You
must have something. That is apparently not you. To yield to. Because
until you learn to yield, you're still going to maintain this false
sense of authorship and authority. That you fool yourselves with. And
there's no humility in it and there's no joining in it and there's no
defenselessness in it and so the Holy Spirit, which is your right mind.
Is something you have to yield to. And until you yield to it, it will
seem to be different from you.
