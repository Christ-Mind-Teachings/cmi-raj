There has to come. An awakening of a desire in you. To reflect the
Father truly. And to express sanity. which requires you To stop acting
out. Insanity. To stop Acting out. Unkind. Hateful Behavior Your mind
has to be Enlivened with truth and enlivened with love. And you have to
let that find embodiment in your actions. The means of doing that. is
turning to the altar. And not relying upon your best judgments and your
best definitions and your best ideas. And asking to be filled with the
father's point of view.
