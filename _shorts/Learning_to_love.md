The process of awakening. is one in which You learn to love again. And
you don't know how to love. Because you are in fear. And therefore
Always on defense. And so in order to learn how to love. You must turn
away. From what you have been relying upon to give meaning to everything
which are the mutually agreed upon definitions. And Since that is where
your total focus has been. It is going to seem to you that you're going
to have to turn to a point completely outside anything you're familiar
with. Even though You are turning back toward home. And Laying the
groundwork for the aha, the light bulbs that will go on in your mind.
Illuminating that your mind is whole. And never became less than whole.
Even though Your act of independence caused your attention to become
focused only we might say in a very narrow bandwidth of the capacity of
your mind. So It's all about love. And love can't be explained to you.
You can only be pointed in the direction. Where the experience awaits
you.
