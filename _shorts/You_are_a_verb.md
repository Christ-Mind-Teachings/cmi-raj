Be present with and available to everyone. Without the exercise of
control. And with the resultant discovery that without control being
exercised, Existence doesn't collapse. And that therefore it is safe for
him. To not be in control. And to discover that he doesn't cease to
exist. And that not only is he not who he thought he was. He is an
indescribable presence of conscious awareness. That can be utterly
appropriate in every situation. With complete safety and fearlessness.
And that therefore he is a verb and not a noun. Nouns seem to anchor you
in security. And that's why you conceive of yourself as a thing. But
what you are is a movement. Of being. It is joyous. And you truly have
nothing else to do but let God be you.
