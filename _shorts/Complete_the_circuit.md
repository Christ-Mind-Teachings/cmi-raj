As you let in. The clearer experience of reality. As you let The
father's love in because you desire to extend it. You, for lack of
better words, complete the circuit. The key lies in the willingness to
share it. You will never be in charge of the sunship. But beginning to
have a devotion to your brothers and sharing it. It's like bringing both
poles of a battery into play, where there is power, where there is a
completed circuit. Ultimately, Your devotion to your brothers is
expressed by your turning to the Father and asking. What is appropriate
for me to be in this circumstance or this situation? Show me what to do.
And the Father shows you what to do and love finds expression in you
that is extended to your brothers.
