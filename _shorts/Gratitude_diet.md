I want you to give your attention to being grateful for what you have.
And Don't waste your time. Being ungrateful about or preoccupied with
the things you don't have. The saying is what you appreciate
appreciates. I want you to go on a diet of gratitude. For everything you
have. Because you are blessed. Blessings fade into the background when
the attention is given to what you don't have. And with it The
experience of gratitude. And gratitude is a form of love, isn't it?
Gratitude is a form of acknowledging God. Gratitude is a form of
witnessing for God.
