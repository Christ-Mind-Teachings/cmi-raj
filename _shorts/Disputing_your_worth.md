## {{page.title}}

Your worth was established by God. As long as you dispute this. Hm. You
say, well, why would I dispute that? Well, you dispute it. By not
checking in with God, by not thinking about God, by not thinking with
God as you engage in um The simplest of relationships in your day. You
dispute the fact that your worth was established by God. In every
attempt you make to establish it in the eyes of your brothers. Instead
of saying to hell with what they think and letting your already existing
worth. Shine forth. For no good reason not to teach anybody anything,
but because you have no pleasure other than Letting The capital M
meaning embodied right where you are by God as an expression of Himself.
To be the only thing present right where you are. And letting the chips
fall where they may.
