It is a good idea not to engage in evaluating your skill as a learner.
And not to make commitment to the process of learning. Learning is
unavoidable. But don't make commitment to learning. Be willing to
abandon learning at any moment. Because to the degree that you have not
locked yourself into a learning process, you are a prime target for an
inspiration and an insight. And a direct penetration of your divinity.
Because it's in the unguarded moments. That this happens. So don't place
too high a value on learning. Place your value. On being receptive. And
then to the best of your ability, be defenseless against. The influx. Of
that which you haven't entertained before, of that which you haven't
allowed to be in your presence before.
