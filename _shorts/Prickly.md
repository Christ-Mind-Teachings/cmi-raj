## {{page.title}}

I can be sweet and I can be prickly. But always it's on behalf of
forward movement and growth and enlightenment. And I am never more
prickly than you or anyone else can bear. But I am also as prickly as
any of you can bear. In order to help you not waste time. In whatever
the form of your stupid rest is. that each of you has. To whatever
degree any of you are self-satisfied. While not being awake. You are
engaged in stupid rest. And love breaks the stupid rest. Love expressed
breaks the stupid rest because love felt motivates, causes movement. Now
don't be prickly with each other. Without guidance. Because just being
prickly. Without the unction of love. Amounts to hate practiced. So it
isn't, you can't say, well, I'm going to be prickly for your good.
Because you don't know what prickly will be for their good if it's not
revealed to you. Because it won't come with the unction of love when you
start with yourself where you think you are at the moment.
