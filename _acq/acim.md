          Since 2003 Raj has been teaching <em>A Course In Miracles</em>
          from the Sparkly book. This cross reference will quickly link you with
          Raj sessions on a section by section basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Raj started the Study Group in 2002 reading from the FIP edition and
          switched to the Sparkly Edition in July 2003. Scroll the table
          of contents to Chapter 4 where he begins with section 1.
