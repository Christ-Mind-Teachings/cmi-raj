title: Afterword

Thus, a journey has begun. Not just Paul’s, but yours—not a journey in space or
time, not even an inner journey toward something which you are not yet. Rather,
it is a journey of undoing, of stopping the movement away from What You
Are—into a personal, private, individualistic sense of yourself. It is an
inevitable journey because you cannot ignore your Self indefinitely. Who and
What You Are will keep stepping up and confronting you, slapping you in the
face to get your attention, because it is insane to function as through you are
out of your Mind—the conscious experience of your Fullness.

The “journey” constitutes a return to the primitive and ultimate conscious
experience of your Being, and therefore constitutes an “unjourney”. In its
simplicity, it is effortless. Indeed, all effort is ego and constitutes the act
of separation. Thus, you must allow yourself into the Kingdom of Heaven—the
unadulterated, undistorted Conscious experience of Being.

To have an ending to this book would be to give you the answer, when the fact
is that you are the answer, and you will write your own book in the language of
your own conscious experience. It is your Self which you must come face to face
with and agree to be. It will not be easy, but it need not be hard; and, as I
said, it is inevitable.

You are not, and will not be alone in this journey, although it will be
absolutely individual. You are on it, whether you are consciously engaged in it
or not, because of What You Really Are. Your success is assured because you
began your journey from your destination, and Actually never left it except in
the illusory ego sense.

It is so simple!
